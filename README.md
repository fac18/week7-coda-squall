## Requirements this time

As per the [project brief](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/master-reference/blob/master/coursebook/week-7/project.md)

- [x] Login form with 2 fields - username and password
- [x] Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
- [ ] Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
- [ ] Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
- [x] There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not
- [x] Website content should be stored in a database
- [x] Include thorough tests on the back-end, testing pure functions and testing routes using Supertest. If you make external API calls, use Nock to mock the response for your tests
- [ ] Test front-end logic, we don't expect tests on the DOM
